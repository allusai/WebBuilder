# WebBuilder
WebBuilder allows users to build websites just with the power of their voice. We designed this skill for the Amazon-Okta 2018 Hackathon in which we won 2nd place and received free Amazon Echos to continue our journey with Alexa skill development. When developing this tool, we were targeting people who have no HTML/CSS experience and businesses who need to be able to develop quick prototypes during meetings to see their ideas come to life.

A lot of people are discouraged from learning web design because they think coding is hard. I was one of those people. To help solve this persistent issue, we are enabling future developers to see how cool web design can be though this Alexa skill.
